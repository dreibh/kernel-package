kernel-package (3.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the kernel rules file not break on the sound modules of
    2.1.70+ kernels (I think it is a bug in the kernel Makfile, but this
    fix make make-kpkg handle the problem and be more robust).

kernel-package (3.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified image.postinst to also cater to people on whose architecture
    the image is not called vmlinuz but something else (like vmlinux, for
    example). closes:Bug#16258
  * Fixed two minor doc typos for make-kpkg. closes:Bug#16224

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Dec 1997 13:07:21 -0600

kernel-package (3.49) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the postrm's also know about the kernel versrion, not just the
    postinst. (Sorry). closes:Bug#15920
  * Changed include.postrm to be more careful about removing the symbolic
    link /usr/src/linux-X.Y.Z. Keep track if there is another package
    installed that could provide the link.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Dec 1997 23:04:47 -0600

kernel-package (3.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Important changes for kernel-source-* and kernel-header-* packages: now
    kernel-source-* packages also provide the exact kernel-header-* (libc6
    need only depend on kernel-header-* now.
  * The kernel-header-* and kernel-source-* packages now also maitain the
    /usr/src/linux-X.YY.ZZ links (in addition to the /usr/src/linux links)
    This is used in the libc6 package.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Dec 1997 12:46:47 -0600

kernel-package (3.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added HAM modules to the module we know about, these were introduced
    in 2.1.70.
  * Added configure as a valid target to make-kpkg, so people can
    make sure that edits to configuration files are not stomped over by
    make-kpkg (most people can ignore this)

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Dec 1997 23:27:04 -0600

kernel-package (3.46) unstable; urgency=low

  * Because of new option rootcmd (for sudo and fakeroot and such), one
    can't just use -r as a shortcut for -revision (since it is now
    ambiguous). Fixed README to reflect this. closes:Bug#15016
  * Added documentation of rootcmd to the help message (make-kpkg
    -h). This, along with the above, closes:Bug#15078
  * Fixed a type in a rules command (negated test). This closes:Bug#15276 
  * Added documentation about problems with encaps to the problems file. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Dec 1997 13:54:20 -0600

kernel-package (3.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore unmounted devices while looking for a root file system. Much
    thanks to Thomas Kocourek <tko@westgac3.dragon.com> for noticing
    this. 
  * Added handling for root_cmd in the rules file. This should be set to
    `sudo' or `fakeroot' and is only used in the target buildpackage (it
    calls dpkg-buildpackge -r$root_cmd)
  * Made the rules file notice the env variable ROOT_CMD and over ride the
    site wide default.
  * Added a rootcmd option to make-kpkg and have it set the root_cmd
    variable via ROOT_CMD env variable.
  * Document all the above. closes:Bug#14539
  * Make sure that the copyright file for the kernel-doc package is not
    compressed. closes:Bug#14403,Bug#14405
  * Added internal utility kpkg-vercheck to test the validity of the
    package version.
  * Make the kernel rules file abort immediately if the version number is
    not valid, rather than have the it happen towards the end (after a
    long compile). closes:Bug#14597

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 1997 10:37:08 -0600

kernel-package (3.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install the README.headers in the right place for the source
    package. closes:Bug#14552.
  * Handle the new NLS_MODULES that have appeared in the newest 2.1.6x
    kernels. closes:Bug#14527.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Nov 1997 23:30:48 -0600

kernel-package (3.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added README.headers to the kernel-source package as well, since the
    information _is_ relevant to compiling kernels. Since kernel soiurce
    packages have higher visibility than kernel header packages, this may
    help avoid some FAQs from being asked.
  * Expand on epoch numbers on standard kernel packages. Now the README
    file actually encourages epochs (horrors).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Oct 1997 01:59:19 -0500

kernel-package (3.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed image postinst not to use the obsolete -d option to
    superformat. Removed extra spaces from the exec option, so that it is
    more likely to work. Noticed by Joost Kooij <kooij@mpn.cp.philips.com>
    as BUG#14022
  * Note that the proposed two level versioning scheme fails if standard
    kernels use epochs. Further note that one may introduce epochs even in
    custom kernels. This fixes BUG#14067.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 1997 02:47:22 -0500

kernel-package (3.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle obsolete /System.map and /System.old links left around by older
    kernel-package packages. All the programs that look at the information
    in the map files (including top, ps, and klogd) also will look at
    /boot/System.map-<version>, we just need to ensure that that file is
    present, and no longer require the symbolic link. 
    Actually, having the sumbolic link in / is technically detrimental
    (apart from cluttering up /); many programs, though looking in /boot,
    stll allow /Sytem.map to override. If you use LILO to choose between
    multiple kernels, then the /System.map symbolic link only applies to
    one such kernel, for all other choices the symbols loaded will be
    wrong. Not having the symbolic links at all prevents this. 
    Therefore, the new image.postinst file shall offer to remove the
    symbolic links in /. This should fix BUG#13359

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 10:44:39 -0500

kernel-package (3.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the proposal for the new multi architecture support. Documented
    the new variable patch_the_kernel and the ENV override.  
  * Mentioned new behaviour of depmod and friends Re non .o files in
    /lib/modules in the problems file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Sep 1997 00:02:55 -0500

kernel-package (3.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed handling of modules.dep in the image.postinst. We do not attempt
    to recreate a modules.dep, since the man page admits the file so
    created may be incorrect. We warn the installer that there maybe
    problems loading modules into the kernel intil reboot iff the version
    being installed is the same as the version currently running.
  * This fixes BUG#13009.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Sep 1997 15:07:02 -0500

kernel-package (3.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mentioned other kernel source sites in the copyright file. This fixes
    BUG#11951.
  * Install files while preserving the timestamp (use install -p) 
  * This could be considered a release candidate, as long as a fixed
    dpkg-dev is also provided at the same time. This has been extensively
    tested on the authors machine, and there have been no bugs reported in
    nearly a month.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Aug 1997 12:10:37 -0500

kernel-package (3.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer create a System.map symlink in /, since that may confuse
    klogd when choosing kernel images using LILO. Since top, ps, and klogd
    look at /boot/System.map-<version>, we just need to make sure that
    file is present. This makes us friendlier to multiple images of the
    same kernel version.
  * No longer redirect output to a file in /tmp for security reasons (we
    use a log file in /var/log instead). This fixes BUG#11765,
    BUG#11766 and BUG#11847 
  * Added support for different flavours of the same kernel version for
    people who need them. This is based on the ideas and work of Bill
    Mitchell <mitchell@mozcom.com> and Noel Maddy <ncm@biostat.hfh.edu>.
    This should make us fully compliant to having multiple flavours of the
    same kernel version.
  * Added dependencies to targets in rules. Now things should work as
    expected if one edits a .config file. 
  * Fixed destination for the Buildinfo file. This fixes BUG#11884.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Aug 1997 13:03:38 -0500

kernel-package (3.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * All kernel packages produced now list the version of kernel-package
    used in the file /usr/doc/Buildinfo. This is a bit of a Hack.
  * The image prerm will allow you to remove an running kernel image and
    hose your system. You will be warned. (under protest).
  * Added a variable to choose a no symlink option, which puts the real
    images in /vmlinuz and /vmlinuz.old, not symlinks (similarily for
    System.map). This makes it potentially less useful, since unless other
    action is taken one would have only two images on the machine at the
    time. This has been added for people who use file systems that do not
    implement symlinks.
  * Added a variable to ask for reverse symlinks, that is, vmlinuz is the
    real file, vmlinuz-2.0.30 is the link. This also restricts the system
    to two image files unless the user save a copy, added for people with
    boot on umsdos (can't see symlinks in dos mode) but who want the links
    to see what the image versions are in Linux. Mutualy exclusive with
    the no symlink option. (apart from the symlinks, it is identical to
    the no symlink option). These should fix Bug#11395.
  * Fixed typo in control file for kernel-doc description. This fixes
    Bug#11568.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Jul 1997 17:50:51 -0500

kernel-package (3.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preserve owner when copying the config file around. This fixes
    BUG#11022. 
  * Added final newline in the control file. This fixes BUG#11024.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Jul 1997 22:04:22 -0500

kernel-package (3.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ran spell check on the README file.
  * Added a missing endif in the rules file

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Jun 1997 02:32:42 -0500

kernel-package (3.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer carries around an extra uncompressed kernel image, and does
    not anymore create /boot/psdatabase-X.X.XX. The psdatabase file does
    not seem to be required anymore.
  * Removed all references to psdatabase.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Jun 1997 13:13:15 -0500

kernel-package (3.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * First version to be built with cvs-buildpackage.
  * Added patches to support m68k from "Frank Neumann"
    <Frank.Neumann@Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.DE>.
  * Added patched to support sparcs from Eric Delaunay
    <delaunay@lix.polytechnique.fr> 
  * This fixes Bug#10231.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Jun 1997 18:38:57 -0500

kernel-package (3.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a version number to the dependecy on dpkg-dev, we now require at
    least version 1.4.0.9., since dpkg-gencontrol fails with an error:
    failure: chown new files list file: Illegal seek
    This fixes BUG#10121.
  * Added problems with older versions of dpkg-dev to the problems file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 25 May 1997 22:33:47 -0500

kernel-package (3.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tested with 2.0.30 and 2.1.40.
  * Moved config to /boot, where it arguably should have gone to in the
    first place. The /boot directory contains other information pertinent
    to the kernel, such as the System.map file, and the psdatabase.  The
    information about exactly what was configured into the kernel was
    missing, and it can get quite critical on some machines.  Also, the
    config file may serve as a base for compiling the next kernel. This
    file is not really a configuration file (not when packaged as part of
    the kernel-image package), hence it does not belong in /etc (no amout
    of changing this file will have any affet on system behaviour).  

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 21 May 1997 01:44:17 -0500

kernel-package (3.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Kernel-image and kernel-doc now suggest each other.
  * Also recognize powerpc as a synonym for ppc in determining whether
    we use zImage or bzImage by default.
  * Fixed up some typos in documentation
  * Added rules target kernel_doc. This fixes BUG#9138
  * Also install .config file under /usr/doc. This fixes BUG#9298

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 2 May 1997 14:34:51 -0500

kernel-package (3.28) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer install text files in the modules directory, since depmod
    in modutils-2.1.34 fails when it finds a non-ELF file in modules
    directory. This fixes Bug#9243.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Apr 1997 15:24:51 -0500

kernel-package (3.27) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Really add in all the changes sent in by Herbert Xu. The changes are: 
    * Changed to source package name back to kernel-source-=V again. 
    * Changed the install's to be without -o root -g root since it is no
      longer useful as the chown's are done before the packages are built. It
      also means that if it is used in targets like stamp-configure which may
      be run by anyone it won't not generate an error.
    * Made rules file generate the control file.
    * Fixed some typos in chowns commands while generating the header
      packages. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Apr 1997 15:12:19 -0500

kernel-package (3.26) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the default image for ppc architecture zImage. This fixes Bug#8696 .
  * Forgot to mention that the source package for the kernel packages
    (produced by make-kpkg buildpackage, for example) has been changed to
    not contain the kernel version as part of the name (all the deb files
    produced have not changed), so we now get kernel-image-xxx_yy_zz.deb,
    kernel-source-xxx_yy_zz.deb, and kernel-headers-xxx_yy_zz.deb, along
    with kernel-source.tar.gz and kernel-source_yy.diff.gz
  * Added config dependencies for module targets

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Apr 1997 00:53:24 -0500

kernel-package (3.25) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added changes sent in by the kernel packages maintainer.

  * Fixed typos in rules for generating external modules

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 9 Apr 1997 12:41:45 -0500

kernel-package (3.22) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Documented constraints on the debian revision field. This is important
     enough that I am reproducing the text of the admonition here.
     The revision number (the argument supplied after the --revision flag)
     has certain constraints: it may contain only alphanumerics and the
     characters + . (full stop, and plus) and should contain a digit.
     NOTE: No hyphens allowed. (Look at Chapter 5 of the Programmers manual
     for details)

     This is because dpkg imposes an ordering on version numbers, so that
     it can tell whether packages are being up or downgraded and so that
     dselect can tell whether a package it finds available is newer than
     the one installed on the system.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 4 Apr 1997 11:48:42 -0600

kernel-package (3.21) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Tested source package creation for 2.1.30
  * set umask to copy the kernel source files untainted by package creators

kernel-package (3.20) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Could not reproduce BUG#8274, neither could the original reporter. I have
    made some changes in the postinst to allow leading whitespace in the
    user responses, and tested it on three different kernel-source
    versions.  I believe this bug is fixed now (I have 3 suitable boot
    floppies as evidence). 
  * image postinst no longer aborts when the user gives up on formatting a
    floppy, but now offers a choice to proceed with a preformatted floppy. 
  * Fixed spelling errors in kernel image postinst, fixing BUG#8409
  * Offer to user superformat if it exists.
  * Tested boot floppy creation.
  * Tested on 2.0.29, 2.1.29, and 2.1.30
  * Spell check the Problems file, mention setfdprm in there.
  * Mention setfdprm in postinst if fail to format floppy.
  * Fix a typo in code determining which floppy drive to use
  * Allow leading whitespace in responses
  * Added required packages to the README file.

kernel-package (3.18) unstable; urgency=high

  * Succesfully compiled a 2.1.27 kernel.
  * Made make-kpkg not look for modules directoryi; that directory is
    removed by a make-kpkg clean.
  * Mentioned that ncurses-dev is required for make menuconfig in the

  * Started compiling a list of known problems with compiling kernel images.
    This is now available as /usr/doc/kernel-package/Problems.
  * Moved to standards version 2.1.2.2.
  * Removed extra root checks in the rules file.
  * Added error messages to failed root check in the rules file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 00:56:48 -0600

kernel-package (3.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more injunction to run make-kpkg clean regularly
  * Remove /lib/modules/$version/modules.dep if it exists.  Recreate 
    immediately with depmod -a.  This will help reinstall the same kernel
    version more than once.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 00:38:59 -0600

kernel-package (3.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added suggestions for fdutils and LILO for the kernel_image package.
  * Fixed typo in include.postinst.  Fixes BUG#6692.
  * Added warnings about possible (recent?) failure to autodetect floppy
    drives if using old fdformat from miscutils while creating a boot disk.
    This addresses BUG#6037.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jan 1997 12:03:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * *ALERT*.  Changed how customization variables are handled. All
    variables are given reasonable (IMHO) defaults.  Then the site
    customization file /etc/kernel-pkg.conf is read in, which can
    over-ride the defaults. THEN, the environment/command line variables
    are used to over-ride the values.
  * New env variables: KPKG_MAINTAINER, KPKG_EMAIL, IMAGE_IN_BOOT,
    IMAGE_TYPE 
  * new customization variables: kimage, image_in_boot
  * Edited README to give bare bones documentation for user customizable
    vars. 
  * Added man page kernel-pkg.conf.5.
  * Normalized existing man pages according to the templates floating
    around on the list.
  * Added copyright statements to the man pages.
  * Documented changes in make-kpkg
  * Added --bzimage option to make-kpkg for completeness.
  * Added a --zimage option to make-kpkg, (with support in the rules file),
    to make a zImage kernel rather than a bzImage kernel (the default). 
    Useful for people having problems with bzImage kernels. Suggested by 
    Richard G. Roberto <richr@Bear.COM>
 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 7 Jan 1997 12:44:00 -0600

kernel-package (3.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added documentation to the effect that make-kpkg is part of
    kernel-package in various README's. 
  * Made the final location of vmlinuz configurable (since one may have
    it under /boot as well as /).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 2 Jan 1997 11:27:06 -0600

kernel-package (3.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a man page for internal script kernel-packageconfig.  This fixes

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Dec 1996 23:40:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow local configuration of the destination of all kernel related
    deb file (the default remains ..).  Now one can set it to directories
    like ../kernel-deb or /boot/archive/deb or whatever by setting the
    variable DEB_DEST in the conf file.
  * Offer user a choice about floppy drive to use. Also make it explicit
    which floppy drive is being used. This fixes BUG#6037.
  * Warn intel users that they should get bin86 as well, if they intend
    to compile a custom kernel.  This fixes BUG#6144.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Dec 1996 18:09:51 -0600

kernel-package (3.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * The package needs dpkg-gencontrol to do any work whatsoever, so it
    should depend on dpkg-dev, instead of merely recommending it.  
    This fixes BUG#6040.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Dec 1996 01:54:01 -0600

kernel-package (3.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dpkg (>= 1.4) to the dependencies, since older versions do
    not understand the new dpkg --build syntax.  This fixes BUG#6041
  * Fixed target modules config in kernel/rules. This fixes BUG#5836
  * Latest default kernel config file

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Nov 1996 15:11:12 -0600

kernel-package (3.03) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * changed priority of kernel-source package to optional
  * changed priority of kernel-image package to optional
  * Recommended dpkg-dev since kernel/rules call binaries from there
    This fixes a problem that a number of people have reported on the

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Nov 1996 11:02:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * kernel-source-X.XX now no longer recommends bin86, since bin86 is only
    available intel platforms.  It now merely mentions it in the

  * Changed one last typo in postinst. This (finally) fixes Bug#4234. 
  * Also, version 3.00 fixed Bug#4500 and Bug#4624
  * kernel-source-X.XX now recommends bin86, which fixes Bug#4443
  * Added short, succint (and potentially dangerous) instructions on
    compiling kernels at the top of the README file.  This fixes Bug#4445.

kernel-package (3.00) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed the kernel-package to the new packaging schemes.
  * Removed the dist, source, and diff targets for make-kpkg, added
    binary-arch, binary-indep, and buildpackage targets.
  * Changed make-kpkg to reflect reorganization of the
    /usr/lib/kernel-package/ tree.
  * Changed Authour email.
  * Removed dithering about ./debian/* in kernel sources, now make-kpkg
    looks only at /usr/lib/kernel-package/ (clears confusion about older
    versions of kernel-package).
  * Modified make-kpkg.8 to reflect changes in make-kpkg, and ran a spell
    check. 
  * Renamed debian/package.config to kernel-packageconfig, and removed
    (obsolete) references to dchanges)
  * Moved *.README to copyright.*, and changed the rules files to
    conform. 
  * Added explanation for kernel-headers-X.XX (and why we need this
    package inspite of having headers in libc5-dev)

kernel-package (2.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in make-kpkg man pages where it insisted that it was
    make-dpkg ;-) 
  * Made the close brackets agree with open brackets in the man page
    synopsis.   This fixes Bug#3960

kernel-package (2.02) unstable; low

  * Made image.postinst more polite.
  * Also enabled kernel-{source,image,headers} targets in kernel.rules 
  * Changed make-kpkg to also accept the new targets.
  * Fixed typo in man page.
  * The man page says it is an adminstrators man page rather than a 
    programmers man page.
  * Recommended libc-dev for kernel-source and kernel-package
  * source suggests ncurses3.0-dev, tk40-dev and the description explains 
    you could use make menuconfig rather than plain old make config if you
    had these packages.
  * Fixed typo in the rules for modules in /usr/src/modules/ directory
  * Made the rules for such modules ignore errors (since they are not
    really a part of this package, error there should not halt this build
    (or so people seem to want it)
  * Look for modules in the kernel config file (or the default config file
    if the user has not supplied a config file), and only make modules and
    install them if modules have been configured in the config file. This 
    could be tested better.
  * Fixed the make-kpkg.8 man page so that it now does not seem to mandate
    a source and diff file for additional modules installed under the 
    directory /usr/src/modules/ (whether these files are produced is at
    the discretion of the maintainer of that modules package.
  * Make configure depend on stamp-configure which in turn depends on
    .config Hopefully, this will remake the image atrget if one changes
    the config file Hopefully, this will not cause the image target to
    build needlessly.

kernel-package (2.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the scripts to refer to /usr/bin/perl rather than /bin/perl.
  * Added an extended description to the image control file.
  * Added a note that the dist target requires a PGP key.
  * Fixed a typo (missing DEBDIR) in debian.rules.
  * Fixed the targets expected by make-kpkg (kernel_image rather than 
    kernel-image, etc).
  * In image.postinst, made arguments to system be a single argument if  
    the arguments contain shell metacharacters, (this way perl passes
    them to sh -c).
  * Made make-kpkg accept non floats as revision numbers, to facilitate  
    local names.
  * Fixed silly bug in makefloppy in image.postinst.
  * Fixed the extended description of the kernel-package package.
  * Updated the image postinst to install the mbr, if it exists, and to
    activate the root partition, and to not overwrite the mbr (oops).
  * Changed maintainer email address to debian.org (I'll be in a state of  
    flux soon)
