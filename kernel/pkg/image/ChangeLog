	* config:  New file. This contains all the questions, usually
		  acted upon during the postinst, that can be asked before
		  the package is unpacked.  

	* prerm:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Added variable $package_name  

	* preinst (check):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  This is the other file to have undergone
		  debconfication. All the questions asked are still here
		  -- we just use debconf to ask the user. Also, the
		  priority, and need to brak non-interactive installs was
		  re-evaluated, and the preinst breaks in far fewer cases
		  than it did before. 

	* postrm:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Added variable $package_name  

	* postinst:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  This file has been greatly changed. Firstly, it uses
		  debconf; and gets rid of the code that generated boot
		  floppies and created lilo.conf (that latter was probably
		  illegal under current policy anyway.)A number of
		  questions have been moved to the config file
		  (create-kimage-link-$version, old-initrd-link,
		  old-dir-initrd-link,  old-system-map-link) while others
		  are asked conditionally in the  postinst (depmod-error,
		  depmod-error-initrd, bootloader-test-error,
		  bootloader-error). The postinst has also become far less
		  verbose; the  users are far better educated a decade
		  after this was written, and there are other sources of
		  information about booting than the postinst of a kernel
		  image.
