	* version_vars.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  This file looks at the top level kernel Makefile, and
		  extracts the components of the version string. It uses
		  the kernel Makefile itself, so it takes into account
		  everything the kernel Makefile itrself pays attention
		  to. This file also calculated the obsolete Debian
		  specific Flavour variable. 

	* patches.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  This file deals with setting up variables, looking at
		  directories, and creating a list of valid third party
		  patches available for the kernel being built. 

	* modules.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  This file deals with setting up variables, looking at
		  directories, and creating a list of valid third party
		  modules available for the kernel being built. 

	* initrd.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  This snippet uses hard coded version based heuristics to
		  determine which set of tools would be viable for
		  providing an initrd or initramdisk for the kernel being
		  built, if initrd's are selected by the user as desired. 

	* defaults.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  This file sets default values for  variables _before_
		  the user configuration files are read. 

	* config.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Various internal variable set based on defaults and the
		  user configuration files, or from environment vars. 

	* checks.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Various checks that would let the build process detect
		  and abort on various error conditions.
