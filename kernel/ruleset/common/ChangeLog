	* archvars.mk (MAKING_VIRTUAL_IMAGE):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-155
		  also consider CONFIG_X86_64_XEN (any more architectures
		  that Xen would support, this method is gonna get
		  untenable). This'll fix Xen building on AMD64

	* archvars.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-138
		  Do not set -a for dpkg-architecture if compiling for
		  another arch in a multiarch set. Additionally, this
		  prevents us from confusing dpkg-architecture by asking
		  it to tell us  about vars for the arch "-".

	* archvars.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-133
		  Look into .config to see if we are running a Xen compile

	* targets.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-112
		  Most the targets were using  testdir as a prerequisite,
		  with the unfortunate result that since the testdir
		  target can never really be up to date, every target was
		  always  remade. By using the alternate $(checkdir) on
		  all non-common targets, we can probably reduce unneeded
		  rebuilding of targets a lot.

	* debconf.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-75
		  Do not use echo, since this is often used inside make
		  rules 

2005-11-02  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* README: Describes what this directory is used for.

	* pkgvars.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  New file. This is what allows us to separate out the top
		  level targets, by determining which packages need to be
		  built.

	* install_cmds.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  New file, pulling these out of the local-vars file. 

	* debconf.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  New file, in preparation for the forthcoming
		  debconfication. 

	* targets.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Made all the targets verbose. This is likely to be a
		  temporary measure, but who knows. 

	* archvars.mk (REASON):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Changed the wording for non-file targets.
