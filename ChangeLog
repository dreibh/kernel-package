	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
		  removed the mention of the cramfs patch, and also
		  removed references to INITRD_OK, which is now obsolete 

	* make-kpkg:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
		  removed the mention of the cramfs patch, and also
		  removed references to INITRD_OK, which is now obsolete 
		  (main):
			  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
			  Removed the check and the warning when
			  --initrd was being used. Now we just add
			  the INITRD=YES to the command line and
			  go on.  

	* README (so):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
		  Remove cramfs patch warning in a couple of places (we
		  used to tell people to be sure to apply the cramfs patch
		  or tell mkinitrd not to use cramfs, and this is no
		  longer required for modern kernels)
