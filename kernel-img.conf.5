.SH NAME
kernel\-img.conf \- site wide configuration file for kernel image packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file 
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
is a simple file looked at by the kernel image post installation
process to allow local options for handling some aspects of the
installation, overriding the defaults built into the image itself. 
.PP
The format of the file is a simple 
.B VAR = VALUE 
pair. This file is automatically created by the installation script if
it does not exist, and niether does the symbolic link
.I /vmlinuz.
The script asks the user whether the symbolic link should be created, 
and stashes the answer into 
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
.PP
At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:
.TP
.B image_in_boot:  
Set to True if you want the kernel image 
.I vmlinuz 
in 
.I /boot 
rather than the default 
.I /.  
defaults to undefined.
.TP
.B do_symlink
By default, the kernel image post installation script shall create or
update the 
.I /vmlinuz
and 
.I /vmlinuz.old 
symbolic links. This is true if a 
.I /vmlinuz
link already exists, however, in absence of
.I /vmlinuz,
the script looks to see if this configuration file exists. If it does
not, the configuration scripts asks the user whether to create the
symbolic link, and stashes the answer in a newly created
.I /etc/kernel-img.conf.
If the configuration file already exists, and 
if this option is set to no, no symbolic link is ever created. This
for people who have other means of booting their machines, and do not
like the symbolic links cluttering up their / directory. 
.TP
.B no_symlink
Whether to use symlinks to the 
.I image
file. 
Mutually exclusive to 
.I reverse_symlink. 
Can be used with
.I image_in_boot. 
The image is placed in vmlinuz (instead of /boot/vmlinuz-X.X.XX). The
old vmlinuz is moved to vmlinuz.old unconditionally. (Normally, that
is only done if the version of the new image differs from the old
one). This restricts you to two images, unless you take additional
action and save copies of older images. This is for people who have
boot on a system that does not use symbolic links (and say, they use
loadlin as a boot loader). This is a Hack.
Defaults to  undefined (optional)
.TP
.B reverse_symlink
Whether to use reverse symlinks (that is, the real file is the one
without the version number, and the number version is the link) to the 
.I image
file. 
Mutually exclusive to 
.I no_symlink.
Can be used with
.I image_in_boot.
Just like 
.I no_symlink, 
except that the
/boot/vmlinuz-X.XX is symbolic linked to the real new
image, vmlinuz. This too restricts you to just two
images unless father action is taken. The older
symlinks are left dangling. This is for people with
boot on umsdos, and who can't see the link in dos, but
do want to know the image version when in Linux. 
This is a Hack.
Defaults to  undefined (optional)
.TP
.B image_dest 
If you want the image to be stored in elsewhere than
.I /boot
set this variable to the dir where you want the image. This may be of
help to
.B loadlin
users.Defaults to 
.I /boot.
This over rides all the above methods.
